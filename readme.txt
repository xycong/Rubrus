A multiplayer board game created in the Java programming language using Eclipse IDE. Players attempt to fit as many of their pieces as thy can on the board. A maximum of 4 players can play in team of 2 (in order to play 2 vs 2) or free-for-all.

Players play the game using the mouse and keyboard. The mouse can be used to move, select and rotate the curretly selected piece, while the keyboard can be used to flip the current piece or to skip a turn.

Rubrus was created in Grade 11 using Java and Eclipse

Rubrus was a group collaboration between Tristan Amini, Chen Chou and myself. Tristan wrote the interaction between pieces and the movement of pieces. Chen worked on assigning the input devices (mouse, keyboard) to navigating and playing the game. Using JFrame and JPanel, I designed the GUI of the game. I created all the graphics, UI (menus) and designs of pieces in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator and then implemented them into the game panel.
